# [Gravitalia Finance](https://news.gravitalia.com/)
> Aggregated economic and financial data; *will support predictions related to some*.

## Reason for existence
While Google Finance focuses on stock markets, the World Bank doesn't allow certain data to be compared with others: Gravitalia Finance was created to bring together both economic data (IMF, World Bank, etc.) and financial data (stock markets) to compare them.
